ðŸ‘‹ Welcome to the source code of my [personal site](https://alexpate.uk).

## Installation

How to get this site running locally:

* `git clone https://github.com/alexpate/alexpate.uk`
* `npm install`
* To develop the site: `npm run start`
* To build the site for production: `npm run build`
* The site should now be running at http://localhost:8000

## Deployment

As it's a static site, the site is hosted in an S3 bucket, which is then served via a heavily cached cloudfront instance.

Deployment happens on CircleCI, which is triggered whenever a commit is pushed to master (or staging).
